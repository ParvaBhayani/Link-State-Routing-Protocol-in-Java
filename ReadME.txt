Goal :
Link State Routing Simulation using Dijkstra's Algorithm
This project was a part of CS542 Computer Networks - I course. The main goals of the implementation of Link State Routing Protocol are as follows:

-Getting all the shortest path(s) from a given source node to destination node with the given network topology (as specified in adjacency matrix).
-Generating routing table (connection table) for each node (router) in the network.
-Using Dijkstra’s algorithm to obtain the shortest path as well as the direction between two nodes.
-Functionality to modify an edge i.e. modifying link weight of a existing edge between two nodes and also to add a new link/edge between two nodes. In both the cases, the shortest path(s) has to be updated.
-Functionality to add a node to the existing topology and consequently find a new connection table, and shortest path(s) from a source node to a destination node.
-Display all the possible paths between two directly connected nodes.


The folder consists of:

1. Executable JAR File (Link_State_Routing.jar) with 3 different Test files
	test1.txt (on the basis of which the code has been designed
	test2.txt (rows!=columns)
	test3.txt (diagonals are not zero)

2. A 'src' and 'bin' folder which contains the source code of the program ( Link_state_Routing.class and Link_State_Routing.java)

3. A project report(Contating Detalied Explanation of What the program is about and how to run the program and to what extent the program is able to handle the errors)

Note: Jar file, Batch file and test cases file should be placed together in the same folder.
